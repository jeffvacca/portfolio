			<p className="mb-4 text-slate-800 text-lg">I started my career in music.  While working at <a className="bg-gradient-to-r from-sky-400 to-fuchsia-600 px-1 text-white" href="https://jsmmusic.com/" target="_blank">JSM Music</a>, I learned some Flash during my downtime at the studio.  I created a website where we could create custom video reels, compiled from our existing catalog, and send them to prospective clients while pitching for jobs.  This solved a major problem for the company as the existing solutions at the time were quite costly.  It was here that I caught the bug and decided to transition to web development full time.  Similar to my work in my previous career as a sound engineer, I enjoy operating at the intersection of the creative and the technical.</p>
			<p className="mb-4 text-slate-800 text-lg">Fast-forward to today and I have spent the last twelve years happily building software solutions, first for the <a className="bg-gradient-to-r from-sky-400 to-fuchsia-600 px-1 text-white" href="https://www.nydailynews.com/" target="_blank">New York Daily News</a>, and most recently at <a className="bg-gradient-to-r from-sky-400 to-fuchsia-600 px-1 text-white" href="https://www.andmore.com/" target="_blank">ANDMORE</a>.  </p>
			<p className="mb-4 text-slate-800 text-lg"><a className="bg-gradient-to-r from-sky-400 to-fuchsia-600 px-1 text-white" href="https://www.andmore.com/" target="_blank">ANDMORE</a>, powered by Blackstone Group, is a leading wholesale e-commerce experience within the Home DÃ©cor, Furniture, Gift, and Apparel space.  The sprawling product suite encompasses a digital marketplace, b2b e-commerce websites, a sales rep order writing app, and related admins for each.  I had the opportunity to work across multiple teams, contributing ground up development and new features in a fast paced, Agile environment.  I became something of a utility man, called in when deadlines were tight.  As such, I got to work on several different products, each with their own tech stack. </p>
			<p className="mb-4 text-slate-800 text-lg">At the <a className="bg-gradient-to-r from-sky-400 to-fuchsia-600 px-1 text-white" href="https://www.nydailynews.com/"  target="_blank">Daily News</a>, I was a member of a two person frontend team.  We managed to rebuild and modernize the bulk of the front end during my time there, including the complete responsive redesign of the major site templates.  </p>
			<p className="mb-4 text-slate-800 text-lg">When I&apos;m not at the computer, I can be found with a guitar in my hand.  I am currently performing with <a className="bg-gradient-to-r from-sky-400 to-fuchsia-600 px-1 text-white" href="https://dirtgrunge.com/" target="_blank">DiRT</a>, a 90s grunge tribute band, and have released two full length albums with NYC alt soul act, <a className="bg-gradient-to-r from-sky-400 to-fuchsia-600 px-1 text-white" href="https://li.sten.to/callouttome" target="_blank">Sinner Man</a>.</p>
